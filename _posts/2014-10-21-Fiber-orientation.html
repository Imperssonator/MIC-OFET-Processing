#Long Term Goals 
- Establish a data structure for the quantification of Poly-3-hexylthiophene (P3HT) thin film morphology
- Establish a data structure for the quantification of Poly-3-hexylthiophene (P3HT) thin film morphology

#Information from AFM Image That Matters

1. Identifying fibers
2. Fiber orientation
3. Degree of crystallinity

##Thresholding to 1. Identify fibers 

The thresholding post discusses our algorithm for finding the perfect thresholding value to isolate individual fibers. The following image shows a brief example of our work. 
![thresholding algorithm vizulaized](https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5616/15408121609_eece533bef_b.jpg)

The result of such thresholding will be used to identify each fiber as a connected component. This can be used to find individual fiber orientation. 

##Ellipse fitting to find 2. Fiber orientation 

[regionprops](http://www.mathworks.com/help/images/ref/regionprops.html#bqkf8ik) was used to fit an ellipse to each connected component obtained from the previous thresholding to determine the orientation of that fiber. 

The following example is a proof of concept of finding orientations using regionprops. Of the AFM image(left) , we selected to only 5 components(center). The orientations of the components were accurately calculated and are displayed on the right.
![Ex. of orientation finding](https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5603/15594371682_1d8daa5de0_b.jpg)

The orientation detection along with thresholding is displayed below. Each pixel in the image identified as a fiber can be assigned one of 8 orientations.

###Issues
Overlapping fiber, especially those in completely different directions will contaminate the orientation calculation. 
The image below shows a case where the ellipse fit to the connected component in green will chose the green vector to calculate the orientation of the fiber. This orientation is incorrect for both fibers.

####Possible solution: 

Calculate the eccentricity of the ellipse fit the connected component and if the ellipse cannot possible belong to a single fiber, remove from orientation calculation. Use some other method to perform some sort of local orientation calculation. 


##Peak fitting to find  3. Degree of crystallinity 

Expeimentaing with SciPy in Python. (Would prefer to use python for smooth work flow SwiftStack) 



##Issues 
- Set up python connection with swift
