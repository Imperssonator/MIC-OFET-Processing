#Long Term Goals 
- Establish a data structure for the quantification of Poly-3-hexylthiophene (P3HT) thin film morphology
- Establish a data structure for the quantification of Poly-3-hexylthiophene (P3HT) thin film morphology

#Information from AFM Image That Matters

1. Identifying fibers
2. Fiber orientation
3. Degree of crystallinity

#Orientation 
 The following presentation gives an overview of the algorithm used to find the fiber orientations. This method overcomes initial issues with overlaping fibers and noisy images with gradients in intensity across fibers.
