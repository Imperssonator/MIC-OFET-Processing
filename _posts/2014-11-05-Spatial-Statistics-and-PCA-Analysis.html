#Long Term Goals 
- Establish a data structure for the quantification of Poly-3-hexylthiophene (P3HT) thin film morphology
- Establish a data structure for the quantification of Poly-3-hexylthiophene (P3HT) thin film morphology

#Data 

1. AFM <-- Structure

2. UV-Vis absorbance spectra
3. Electrron Mobility <-- Property 

#Thresholding to 1. Identify fibers 

The thresholding post discusses our algorithm for finding the perfect thresholding value to isolate individual fibers. The following image shows a brief example of our work.

#Spatial Statistics 
##Work Flow:
For each of the 16 stuctures:

1. Created a binary image with thresholding (amorphous or crystaline fiber...no orientation information) 
![ex of binary image](https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5605/15098739033_b05f24e77d_b.jpg)
2. Applied the [SpatialStatsFFt](https://github.com/tonyfast/SpatialStatisticsFFT.git) Matlab function.

An exapmle of the above AFM image autocorrelation result: with a reasonable volume fraction of ~0.32

3.  Perform PCA using matlab functions. 

An example of our sanity check:

Digging into the data a little bit:
Here are the coefficients of the 1st PC

4. Perform perliminary analysis of electron mobility and 1st PC scores.

#What have we learned?
- Longer and wider fibers are favorable for charge transport
- More fibers are not necessarily a good thing if they are small and siconnected 

#Why this matters?
- co-solvent addition is scalable processing method to achieve better charge transport 
- we should study how and why fibers space themselves out: what is happening in teh space between? can we achieve morphologies that explore this domain?

#Still in progress and future work 

#### -We have a method for obtaining orientations but need to incorparate into the spatial statistics and PCA. 
 
#### -Possibly incoorparate degree of crytallinity.
 
#### -We have incorparated UV-Vis absorbance spectra in the PCA but need to better undestand this.
