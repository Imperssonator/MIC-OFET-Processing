#Investigating AFM Images 

Here is an example of an AFM images with highly aligned fibers:

![Aligned fibers AFM Image ](https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2949/15392865571_eaf436ba03_o.png)

We have applied the [SpatialStatsFFt](https://github.com/tonyfast/SpatialStatisticsFFT.git) Matlab function to this image and obtained the following spatial statistics:

Although the plotted spatial statistics contains little infomation about the image, the difference in the spatial statistics is apparent compared to the statistics of an AFM image with few fibers.

####SpatialStatsFFt of Image Sections 
To better utalize the SpatialStatsFFt functions, we calculated statistis for small sections of the AFM image.
