#Long Term Goals 
- Establish a data structure for the quantification of Poly-3-hexylthiophene (P3HT) thin film morphology

#Determine Orientation

See [An algorithm for segmentation of images containing non-overlapping fibrilar domains](http://imperssonator.github.io/MIC-OFET-Processing/2014/11/12/Orientation.html)
Bin the angles like so:
        Bin 1: 90º or -90º .. basically straight up or down
        Bin 2: -45º
        Bin 3: 0º horizontal
        Bin 4: 45º
        Bin 5: amorphous
        
#Spatial Statistics 

There are five micro states, a 5x5 matrix of spatial stats. 

Began with independent stats, so the fist four elements in teh first coloumn. 

- 1-1 autocorrelation
- 1-2 cross correlation
- 1-3 cross
- 1-4 cross

#PCA

Autocorrelation of 90 degree fiber in the PC1

Cross correlation of 90 and 45 degrees in PC1

Cross correlation of 90 and 0 degrees in PC1

#PCs vs Mobility 

We see that the structure with the highest PC1 score has highest mobility.
