In order to reliably fabricate organic electronic devices, we must understand the quantitative relationship between their structure and their electronic properties.One widely studied system is that of poly-3-hexylthiophene (P3HT), a solution-processable polymeric semiconductor, and its charge carrier mobility in field effect transistors.

P3HT has a backbone with good hole conductor properties and side chains athat make it soluble in organic solvents.

The crystal structure of P3HT has been thoroughly established in the extensive literature on the material:

![structure of P3HT](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/8bbe7e79209299f72e536e703d5bbd36d8425661/68747470733a2f2f6c68362e676f6f676c6575736572636f6e74656e742e636f6d2f2d315f5071463873652d71412f56416141704431344568492f41414141414141414159492f566c492d556a5276796d772f77313537362d683335362d6e6f2f5069253242537461636b253242616e6425324265646765253341666163652e6a7067)

(a) (1 0 0) direction: alkyl stacking; (0 1 0): pi-stacking; (0 0 1): chain backbone (b) Face-on orientation, (c) edge-on orientation

Molecular Dynamics Simulations depict the ideal alkyl and pi-stacking conformations.Charge transport is fastest along the extended chain backbone (0 0 1) and pi-stacked directions (0 1 0). It is almost negligible in the alkyl stacking direction. However, the measured hole mobility of a macro-scale film is orders of magnitude lower than that of the crystalline state.

P3HT forms nanofibers during processing whose lengths correspond to the (0 1 0)/pi-stacking direction.The nanofibers are apparent the solid state in the Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) images:

#Goal
Our goal is to quantify the strucutre at top layer of the P3HT thin films, as represented by AFM images and to construct structure-property relationship µ = f(microstructure), where µ is electron hole mobility.

#Data 
[The Reichmanis Group](http://reichmanis.chbe.gatech.edu/research.html) in ChBE performs studies on P3HT structure evolution during processing. They have a substantial collection of Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) data paired with field-effect mobility measurements for P3HT thin film at a wide range of processing conditions.
Twenty such AFM images and their paired mobilities will be used for this study.

#Approach
Simply by inspection, we can choose to regress against average fiber length and obtain a fit with a 2nd order polynomial.(Detailed for obtained the fiber lengths will be discussed in more detail in the method section)

However, many more potentially important features exist:
	- Orientation
	- Area fraction
	- Fiber density

Therefore we needed a systematic method of selecting the most relevant features. To do this we: 
1. Compute spatial statistics for each image in a dataset. Spacital statistics exhaustively generates a vector of microstructural features
2. Perform dimensionality reduction to determine the most informative spatial statistics. Dimensionality reduction was done with Principal component analysis (PCA) which determines linear combinations of spatial statistics that capture the most morphological variation.
