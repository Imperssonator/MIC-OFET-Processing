## AFM Images

We have a large set of AFM images on Flickr:

[AFM Images](https://www.flickr.com/photos/127699624@N02/sets/72157647191955619)

### Here are a couple that we have converted to binary black and white images:



### Each of these images also have associated material properties such as:
* Molecular Weight distributions
* Regioregularity
* The measured OFET mobility, our property of interest

### and other structural data:
* UV-Vis absorbance spectra
* XRD

## Challenges
* Identifying fibers and differentiating between fibers and larger amorphous blobs
* Defining orientations
* Unifying images with their properties in a central location
