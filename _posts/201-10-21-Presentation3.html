#Long Term Goals 
- Establish a data structure for the quantification of Poly-3-hexylthiophene (P3HT) thin film morphology
- Establish a data structure for the quantification of Poly-3-hexylthiophene (P3HT) thin film morphology

#Information from AFM Image That Matters

1. Identifying fibers
2. Orientation
3. Degree of crystallinity   

##Thresholding to 1. Identify fibers 

The thresholding post discusses our algorithm for finding the perfect thesholding value to isolate individual fibers. The following image shows a breif example of our work. 
![thresholding algorithm vizulaized](https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5616/15408121609_eece533bef_b.jpg)

The result of such thresholding will be used to identify each fiber as a connected component. This can be used to find individual fiber oientation. 

##Orientation 

##Peak fitting to find  3. degree of crystallinity 

Expeimentaing with SciPy in Python. (Would prefer to use python for smooth work flow SwiftStack) 



##Issues 
- Set up python connection with swift
