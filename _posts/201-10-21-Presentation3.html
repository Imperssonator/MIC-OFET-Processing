#Long Term Goals 
- Establish a data structure for the quantification of Poly-3-hexylthiophene (P3HT) thin film morphology
- Establish a data structure for the quantification of Poly-3-hexylthiophene (P3HT) thin film morphology

1. Identifying fibers
2. Degree of crystallinity 
3. Orientation  


##Peak fitting to find 1. fibers and 2. crystallinity 

Expeimentaing with SciPy in Python. (Would prefer to use python for smooth work flow SwiftStack) 


##Issues 
- Set up python connection with swift
