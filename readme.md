# AFM Image Segmentation

If you were directed here through a reference in a publication, the AFM segmentation code is a Matlab script called FullSeg2.m

It can be found in _data/FullSeg2.m

It can be sensitive to certain parameters - I will be writing a full paper on this algorithm and its applications, at which point I will make it more user-friendly and well-documented. In its present form, it is only effective on images with non-overlapping fiber-like structures with relatively good contrast.

If you would like to use the code, email me at:
