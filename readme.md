# AFM Image Segmentation

If you were directed here through a reference in a publication, the AFM segmentation code is a Matlab script called Full_Seg2.m in the folder "ACS Nano 2015"

It can be sensitive to certain parameters - I will be writing a full paper on this algorithm and its applications, at which point I will make it more user-friendly and well-documented. In its present form, it is only effective on images with non-overlapping fiber-like structures with relatively good contrast.

If you have questions about how the code works, email me at:
